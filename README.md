- 👋 Hi, I’m @sumit0327
- 👀 As an
Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Birla Institute of Technology (BIT)
Patna Campus, with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in
SAR Image Processing, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills
and passion to the innovative projects.
Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently maintained high academic
achievements, currently holding a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 8.1.
I have honed my technical proficiency in SAR Image Processing, Python
programming, C/C++, and data structures and algorithms. Additionally, I possess a
strong foundation in front-end web development and have gained exposure to
Linux environments.
During my internship at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), I had the
privilege of working alongside distinguished scientists, contributing to the
development of cutting-edge SAR image processing techniques. This experience
has equipped me with valuable insights into real-world applications and problem
solving in the field of electrical engineering. Furthermore, my internship with South
Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited allowed me to apply my knowledge to
address practical challenges in the power sector. I actively engaged in supporting
professionals and offered innovative ideas to enhance operational efficiency.
Beyond my academic and technical qualifications, I have actively participated in
various extra-curricular activities, qualifying for the National Level of the prestigious
CBSE Science Exhibition and competing in renowned coding competitions such as
Google Codejam and Google Hashcode. These experiences have fostered my
ability to think critically, adapt to diverse situations, and collaborate effectively in
team settings.
